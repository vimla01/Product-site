# Clothing brand Landing Page

This is a simple landing page I created for a clothing brand. It’s built using **HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript**. The page is designed to showcase the brand’s style and products in a clean and appealing way.  

## Features
- Responsive layout that works on different screen sizes
- Modern design with brand colors and fonts
- Sections for featured products, about the brand, and contact info
- Simple animations and hover effects for a better user experience

## How I Built It
- **HTML** for structuring the page  
- **CSS** for styling, layout, and responsive design  
- **JavaScript** for small interactions and animations  

## How to View
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to see the landing page.
